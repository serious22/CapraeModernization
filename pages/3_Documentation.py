    * **Select Target Sector(s):** Choose the industry sector(s) relevant to your search (e.g., "Healthcare", "Technology"). Select "All" for a broader search.
    * **Select Target Region(s):** Specify the geographic region(s) where you want to find leads (e.g., "California", "New York"). Select "All" for a nationwide search.
    * **What is your primary goal for these leads?:** This is a crucial step. Your selection here will dynamically adjust the subsequent criteria you can provide. Options include:
        * `Job Search`
        * `Investor Research`

    * **Investor Research:** You'll be asked about "Preferred Investment Stage," "Revenue Threshold / Valuation," and "Focus Technology/Industry Areas."
    * **Sales Prospecting:** You'll define "Target Buyer Type," "Your Product/Service Category," and "Common Pain Points Your Product Solves."

    3.  **Rank Enriched Leads:** Finally, it applies a sophisticated ranking algorithm that considers your `Purpose` and all the `Custom Criteria` you provided. Companies are given a **'Rank Score'** indicating how well they match your needs.

    * **Sector & Region Alignment:** A foundational score for geographic and industry relevance.
    * **Company Size:** Matching your preferred employee count ranges.
    * **Financial Health:** Based on revenue or valuation thresholds you set (e.g., for investor research).
    * **Growth Indicators:** High scores for recent employee growth or significant funding rounds (relevant for job seekers, investors, M&A).
    * **Hiring Activity:** Companies with active hiring are prioritized for job seekers.
    * **Strategic Fit:** Factors like buyer type, product category alignment, or synergy areas (for sales, M&A, market research).
